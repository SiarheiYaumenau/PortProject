# PortProject
Prerequisite Java task for participation in Automated Testing Mentoring program in EPAM 

## Task 1
Design object model for given domain.
Please demonstrate usage of:
- Classes (abstract classes - if applicable)
- Interfaces
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation
- Collections framework.

Each class, method and variable should have meaningful name and purpose. You need to determine which classes are required to solve the task. 
Inheritance should be used only when it makes sense. Classes should be grouped into corresponding packages. Work with console should be minimized 
(only required data for input, output correspond the info in task). It is expected that you will choose certain domain from the list below, define 
classes hierarchy for that domain and implement it using OOP (inheritance or implementing interfaces). 
Each class should have methods and fields defined by you. Your program should create objects of different types in chosen domain and 
combine them into collection (use collections framework). Next, will be required to process data of that collection by certain rules.

## Port domain 
Define ships hierarchy. Create port. Calculate total load capacity. Sort portsâ€™ ships by predefined criteria (define criteria by yourself). 
Find a ship that will match predefined criteria (you could define one or several criteria). 

## Task 2
For the object model implemented in task 1, it is needed to design custom exception classes and implement handling of possible exceptional situations. 
For example, there is no element that meets required criteria in the collection, impossible to delete an element etc. 
Leave your explanation in commented blocks of your exception class. Create at least 3 custom exceptions and use 5 built-in exceptions minimum.
